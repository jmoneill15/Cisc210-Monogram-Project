This program creates an 8x8 grid as a base background, and the program runs to draw 
specific pixels to be displayed in the grid. It starts of running by drawing pixels in 
green to form the letter J for my first name. After having the pixels display for 1 
second, the grid fills to all white to get a plain grid in the background. And then the 
program calls for the pixels of my second initial "O" to be drawn in with green. After
being on the screen for 1 second, the screen with the grid goes away as the program
exits.
